LiteLLM Proxy Integration: Unified gateway for 100+ AI providers  
Temporal Orchestration: Durable workflows for concurrent AI operations  
Smart Resource Allocation: Priority queuing for premium vs standard users  
Fault-Tolerant Architecture: Automatic retries and fallback chains

### 3. Mastra Framework Integration
Template Library Addition: 50+ production-ready AI agent templates  
TypeScript-First Approach: Alignment with VibeCode's tech stack  
Dual-Value Strategy: Library for infrastructure + templates for instant projects  
Multi-LLM Support: Compatible with all existing AI providers

### 4. VS Code Extension Enhancement
Auto-Installation Strategy: Pre-install VibeCode AI Assistant in Docker  
Warning Bypass Configuration: Eliminate security prompts and friction  
Seamless AI Integration: Direct connection to LiteLLM proxy  
Enhanced Developer Experience: Zero-configuration AI assistance

## Key Architectural Improvements

### Before (Current State)
```
User Request → Direct Provider SDK → Single AI Provider → Response
     ↓
- Bottlenecks with multiple users
- No fallback on failures  
- High API costs
- Provider lock-in
- Manual scaling
```

### After (Enhanced Architecture)
```
User Request → LiteLLM Proxy → Temporal Workflow → Smart Router
                    ↓              ↓                ↓
            Unified Gateway    Durable Jobs    Provider Selection
                    ↓              ↓                ↓
            Ollama Local ←→ Azure OpenAI ←→ OpenRouter/Anthropic
                    ↓
            Cached Response + Observability + Cost Tracking
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Zero Queue Times: Smart resource allocation eliminates bottlenecks
- Cost Efficiency: 50-70% cost reduction through local inference + caching
- Privacy First: Sensitive code stays local with Ollama
- Enterprise Scale: Handles 1000+ concurrent AI operations
- Developer Friendly: One API instead of managing 6+ provider SDKs
