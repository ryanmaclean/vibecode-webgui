# Tailwind CSS v4 Migration Notes

## Migration Attempt Summary (July 23, 2025)

### What Was Attempted
- Upgraded from Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 to v4.1.11
- Updated CSS import syntax from `@tailwind` directives to `@import "tailwindcss"`
- Updated PostCSS configuration to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- Installed required dependencies (`lightningcss`)

### Issues Encountered

#### 1. Native Module Dependencies
- **Error**: `Cannot find module '../lightningcss.darwin-arm64.node'`
- **Cause**: Tailwind v4 requires native binaries that weren't properly installed
- **Impact**: Build fails completely

#### 2. Next.js Compatibility
- Tailwind v4 uses a new architecture that may not be fully compatible with Next.js 15.4.2
- The CSS import resolution fails in the Next.js build process

#### 3. Dependency Conflicts  
- Installing v4 dependencies caused peer dependency conflicts with other packages
- dotenv version conflicts with @browserbasehq/stagehand via @langchain/community

### Current Status
- **Reverted to Tailwind v3.4.17** for stability
- All existing Tailwind functionality preserved
- Build process working correctly

### Future Migration Strategy

#### When to Retry
- Wait for Next.js official support for Tailwind v4
- Monitor Tailwind v4 stability and native module distribution
- Resolve @langchain/community dependency conflicts first

#### Recommended Approach
1. **Test in isolated environment** first
2. **Update Next.js** to latest version before attempting v4 migration
3. **Resolve dependency conflicts** in package.json
4. **Use the official upgrade tool** once compatibility issues are resolved:
   ```bash
   npx @tailwindcss/upgrade@latest
   ```

### Performance Benefits (When Working)
- Tailwind v4 promises 3.5x faster full rebuilds
- 8x faster incremental builds
- 100x faster no-change builds

### Breaking Changes in v4
- CSS-first configuration instead of JavaScript config
- `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of `@tailwind` directives
- Important modifier syntax: `h-10!` instead of `!h-10`
- PostCSS plugin moved to separate `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
- Transform properties require explicit transition declarations

### Conclusion
Tailwind v4 is not ready for production use with our current stack (Next.js 15.4.2, complex dependency tree). The migration should be postponed until:
1. Next.js provides official v4 support
2. Native module distribution is more stable
3. Dependency conflicts are resolved upstream

**Recommendation**: Stay with Tailwind v3.4.17 for now, monitor v4 development closely.
