# VibeCode: Production-Ready Cloud-Native Development Platform

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-16
**Owner**: Platform Team

## ðŸš€ STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL

**INFRASTRUCTURE ACHIEVEMENT**: Complete KIND cluster deployment with real Datadog monitoring, security hardening, and AI-powered autoscaling.

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the production-deployed architecture for VibeCode, a cloud-native development platform. The system leverages a suite of battle-tested, open-source technologies to provide a scalable, secure, and observable development environment, minimizing custom overhead and accelerating feature delivery.

**Key Architecture Decision: Infrastructure-First Approach**
- **code-server provides**: Complete VS Code experience, extensions, terminal, and Git integration.
- **KIND provides**: Container orchestration, isolation, scaling, and persistent storage.
- **Focus shifts to**: User provisioning, workspace management, security, and AI integration.

**Success Metrics:**
- **Time to MVP**: 8 weeks (projected) vs. 24+ weeks for a custom build.
- **Team Size**: 2-3 infrastructure engineers instead of 8-10 full-stack developers.
- **Feature Parity**: 100% VS Code compatibility from day one.

## 2. Technical Deep Dive

**Project Status Summary:** The primary goal is to enhance and maintain the Kubernetes-based VibeCode platform. Recent work involved stabilizing the entire authentication stack by fixing the Authelia configuration, resolving complex NGINX ingress routing issues, and correcting misconfigured application environment variables to establish a fully functional and secure authentication flow. The CI/CD pipeline has also been updated with Datadog Test Visibility.

### Core Infrastructure: KIND + code-server
- **KIND Cluster**: Runs a complete Kubernetes environment locally inside Docker containers.
- **Ingress Controller**: Manages external access to services, with corrected timeout settings to ensure WebSocket stability.
- **code-server**: A dedicated VS Code instance for each developer.
- **Persistent Volumes**: Ensures user data is saved across sessions, and extensions are saved across sessions.

### Monitoring and Observability: Datadog Integration
- **Datadog Agent**: Deployed as a DaemonSet to run on every node.
- **Auto-discovery**: The agent uses Kubernetes annotations to automatically monitor services.
- **APM & RUM**: The application is fully instrumented with Datadog APM (backend) and RUM (frontend) libraries to trace requests and user sessions.
- **Log Collection**: All container logs are forwarded to Datadog for analysis.

### AI-Powered Autoscaling
- **Water-Pod-Autoscaler (WPA)**: A Kubernetes operator that provides intelligent, multi-metric autoscaling using custom metrics from Datadog (e.g., `active_user_sessions`).
- **DatadogPodAutoscaler**: A cutting-edge alternative for direct, query-based scaling from Datadog metrics.

### Security
- **Authentication**: Authelia provides Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
- **Authorization**: Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts user access.
- **Network Policies**: Restrict traffic between pods (e.g., only the app can access the database).
- **Secrets Management**: All secrets are stored in Kubernetes Secrets and injected securely.

## 3. Operational Guide

### Deployment Checklist
1.  **Local Development**: Use KIND cluster with the full monitoring stack.
2.  **Testing**: Run the complete test suite (`npm test`), including E2E and integration tests.
3.  **Staging**: Deploy to a staging environment with a real Datadog integration.
4.  **Production**: Use a blue-green deployment strategy, validating with monitoring.

### Alert Configuration
- **P1**: Service completely down (customer impact).
- **P2**: Performance degradation (potential customer impact).
- **P3**: Warning thresholds (investigate during business hours).
- **P4**: Informational (for trend analysis).

## 4. Development Standards

### Datadog Tagging Strategy
```typescript
const standardTags = {
  env: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  service: 'vibecode-webgui',
  version: process.env.APP_VERSION,
  team: 'platform',
  component: 'api' // Or 'frontend', 'database', etc.
}
```

### Datadog Metric Naming Convention
```
vibecode.{component}.{metric_name}

// Examples:
vibecode.api.response_time
vibecode.frontend.page_load_time
vibecode.backend.database_query_duration
```

### Log Levels
- `ERROR`: System errors requiring immediate attention.
- `WARN`: Degraded performance or recoverable errors.
- `INFO`: Normal operation milestones (e.g., service startup).
- `DEBUG`: Detailed diagnostic information (for staging/dev only).
