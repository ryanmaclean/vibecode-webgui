## Coordination Strategy

### Workflow
The personas follow a **sequential workflow** with defined dependencies:

```
Morgan (DevOps) ──┐
                  ├──> Harper (Documentation)
Eli (Security) ───┘

Erin (QA) ────────> Alex (Observability)

Morgan (DevOps) ──> Alex (Observability)
```

### Dependencies

1. **Morgan → Harper**: Deployment changes need documentation
2. **Eli → Harper**: Security updates need documentation
3. **Erin → Alex**: Test results inform monitoring
4. **Morgan → Alex**: CI/CD changes need monitoring

### Communication Channels
- GitHub Issues
- Pull Requests
- Documentation updates

## Using the Personas with MCP

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure the roundtable-ai MCP server is connected
2. Verify the server configuration in `config/mcp_config.json`
3. Confirm available subagents: codex, cursor, gemini

### Invoking a Persona

Use the `use_mcp_tool` with the `codex_subagent` tool:

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>roundtable-ai</server_name>
<tool_name>codex_subagent</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "instruction": "You are [Persona Name], a [Role] with expertise in [expertise areas]. Your focus is on [focus areas]. Please [specific task].",
  "project_path": "/Users/ryan.maclean/vibecode-webgui",
  "is_initial_prompt": true
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

### Example: Invoking Morgan

```xml
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>roundtable-ai</server_name>
<tool_name>codex_subagent</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "instruction": "You are Morgan, a DevOps/Release Engineer with expertise in CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, Docker builds, and release management. Your focus is on Issue #410 (build/deployment discrepancy) and Issue #418 (workflow dispatch merge). Please analyze the current CI/CD pipeline configuration and identify the build/deployment discrepancy.",
  "project_path": "/Users/ryan.maclean/vibecode-webgui",
  "is_initial_prompt": true
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

## Coordination with Sequential Thinking

After creating the personas, use the `sequentialthinking` MCP tool to coordinate their work:

1. **Plan the execution order** based on dependencies
2. **Break down each persona's work** into discrete steps
3. **Track progress** and adjust as needed
4. **Ensure deliverables** are completed before dependent work begins
