# Staff Engineer Digest: VibeCode TODO.md

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-18

## High-Level Project Synthesis & Priorities

### 1. Key Issues & Resolutions

- ✅ **RESOLVED - Ingress Instability & Connection Resets:** The NGINX ingress controller was intermittently closing connections. This was fixed by reducing the `proxy-read-timeout` and `proxy-send-timeout` values to `90s`, preventing network devices from dropping idle WebSocket connections.

- ✅ **RESOLVED - Environment Consistency:** Environment variables were clarified, and `.env.local` was updated to prevent misconfiguration. The CI pipeline now has stable access to the necessary secrets.

- ✅ **RESOLVED - Test Suite Instability:** The CI pipeline now successfully runs the full test suite (`npm test`), including health checks, indicating that major instability and endpoint mismatches have been resolved.

- ✅ **RESOLVED - CI Docker Builds:** The CI pipeline has been hardened to build Docker images for all critical services, ensuring container builds are verified on every commit.

- ✅ **RESOLVED - Accessibility Compliance:** Critical accessibility issues have been resolved after user feedback about poor contrast. The platform now meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards with automated testing infrastructure.
