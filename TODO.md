# Staff Engineer Digest: VibeCode TODO.md

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-20

## High-Level Project Synthesis & Priorities

### 1. Key Issues & Resolutions

- ✅ **RESOLVED - Ingress Instability & Connection Resets:** The NGINX ingress controller was intermittently closing connections. This was fixed by reducing the `proxy-read-timeout` and `proxy-send-timeout` values to `90s`, preventing network devices from dropping idle WebSocket connections.

- ✅ **RESOLVED - Environment Consistency:** Environment variables were clarified, and `.env.local` was updated to prevent misconfiguration. The CI pipeline now has stable access to the necessary secrets.

- ✅ **RESOLVED - Test Suite Instability:** The CI pipeline now successfully runs the full test suite (`npm test`), including health checks, indicating that major instability and endpoint mismatches have been resolved.

- ✅ **RESOLVED - CI Docker Builds:** The CI pipeline has been hardened to build Docker images for all critical services, ensuring container builds are verified on every commit.

- ✅ **RESOLVED - Accessibility Compliance:** Critical accessibility issues have been resolved after user feedback about poor contrast. The platform now meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards with automated testing infrastructure.

### 2. Current Sprint: Core Integration & User Experience

## 🚀 Next Sprint: Platform Hardening & Automation

**Objective**: With core features stable, this sprint focuses on improving developer velocity, system reliability, and security posture.

### **1. CI/CD & Automation**
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: P1 - Reduces manual deployment overhead and risk.

- [✅] **Automate Production Deployments:**
    -   Created a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy to production on pushes to `main`.
- [✅] **Enhance Test Coverage:**
    -   Added integration tests for the AI chat stream API endpoint.
    -   Increased unit test coverage for critical UI components.

### **2. Observability & Monitoring**
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: P1 - Critical for production readiness.

- [✅] **Deploy Datadog Monitoring:**
    -   Replaced Grafana and Alertmanager with Datadog for a unified monitoring, visualization, and alerting platform.
- [✅] **Configure Prometheus as a Datadog Source:**
    -   Prometheus is now streamlined to expose metrics for the Datadog agent.
- [✅] **Centralized Logging:**
    -   Configured the application to produce structured JSON logs and enabled log collection in Datadog.

### **3. Documentation**
**Status**: 📝 Planning
**Priority**: P2

- [✅] **Update Deployment Guides:**
    -   Reflected the new automated deployment process in the documentation.
- [✅] **Onboarding & Contribution Guide**:
    -   Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to guide new developers.

### **4. Security Hardening**
**Status**: 🟡 In Progress
**Priority**: P1 - Essential for user trust and data protection.

- [✅] **Address Dependabot Alerts:**
    -   Updated all dependencies to their latest versions to resolve the flagged vulnerability.
- [✅] **Implement Rate Limiting:**
    -   Implemented rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- [✅] **Secret Scanning:**
    -   Implemented a secret scanning solution using TruffleHog to prevent accidental credential exposure.

---

## 📝 Backlog & Future Ideas

- [🟡] **Performance Tuning & Optimization**:
    -   Set up an initial Datadog synthetic test to monitor the application's health endpoint.
    -   Next, create more comprehensive tests to simulate user journeys and measure performance under load.

- [✅] **Pre-commit Hook Enforcement:**
    -   Address any remaining linting or syntax issues flagged by pre-commit hooks to improve code quality and developer velocity.

## Quick Commands & Troubleshooting

### General
- **Run all tests**: `npm test`
- **Start development server**: `npm run dev`
- **Deploy monitoring stack (Docker)**: `scripts/deploy-monitoring.sh -d <your-datadog-api-key>`
- **Deploy monitoring stack (Kubernetes)**: `scripts/deploy-monitoring.sh -m kubernetes -n vibecode-monitoring -d <your-datadog-api-key>`
