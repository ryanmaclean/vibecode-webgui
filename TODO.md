# Staff Engineer Digest: VibeCode TODO.md

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-16

## High-Level Project Synthesis & Priorities

### 1. Key Issues & Resolutions

- âœ… **RESOLVED - Ingress Instability & Connection Resets:** The NGINX ingress controller was intermittently closing connections. This was fixed by reducing the `proxy-read-timeout` and `proxy-send-timeout` values to `90s`, preventing network devices from dropping idle WebSocket connections.

- âœ… **RESOLVED - Environment Consistency:** Environment variables were clarified, and `.env.local` was updated to prevent misconfiguration. The CI pipeline now has stable access to the necessary secrets.

- âœ… **RESOLVED - Test Suite Instability:** The CI pipeline now successfully runs the full test suite (`npm test`), including health checks, indicating that major instability and endpoint mismatches have been resolved.

- âœ… **RESOLVED - CI Docker Builds:** The CI pipeline has been hardened to build Docker images for all critical services, ensuring container builds are verified on every commit.

### 2. Current Sprint: Platform Stability & Hardening

-   **Objective**: Resolve all outstanding authentication, ingress, and service connectivity issues to establish a stable, secure, and observable baseline for future development.

### âœ… Recently Completed

- [x] **Fix Authelia and Ingress Configuration**
  - [x] Resolved Authelia pod crash loop by fixing cookie domains and service DNS names.
  - [x] Correctly configured NGINX ingress controller via ConfigMap to enable necessary features.
  - [x] Applied final ingress rules and fixed application-level environment variables (`NEXTAUTH_URL`).
  - [x] Verified the complete authentication flow is working correctly.
- [x] **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - [x] Integrated Datadog Test Visibility into the GitHub Actions workflow.

### 3. Top Priorities & Recommendations

- ðŸŸ¡ **Performance & Load Testing:**
    -   With a stable environment, begin performance testing to identify bottlenecks.
    -   Use Datadog to monitor application performance under load and define SLOs.

- ðŸŸ¡ **Pre-commit Hook Enforcement:**
    -   Address any remaining linting or syntax issues flagged by pre-commit hooks to improve code quality and developer velocity.

## Quick Commands & Troubleshooting

### General
```bash
# Check all pods in the vibecode namespace
kubectl get pods -n vibecode

# Tail logs for a specific pod
kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -n vibecode
```

### Database
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL pod logs
kubectl logs -l app=postgres -n vibecode

# Test database connection
kubectl exec -it deployment/postgres -n vibecode -- psql -U vibecode -d vibecode -c "SELECT 1;"
```

### AI Endpoint
```bash
# Check OpenRouter API key
kubectl get secret vibecode-secrets -n vibecode -o yaml | grep OPENROUTER_API_KEY | base64 -d
```
