# VibeCode Active Tasks

## 🔥 Current Priority Tasks

### Critical Issues
- [ ] Fix remaining TypeScript errors in src/middleware/__tests__/security-middleware.test.ts
- [ ] Investigate GitHub security vulnerabilities (1 high, 1 moderate, 3 low)
- [ ] Verify new ESLint configuration works for web-dashboard
- [ ] Test the web application to ensure functionality

### New Features
- [ ] Implement Serena MCP for code-server integration
- [ ] Complete vector database sharding implementation (VectorShardingManager)
- [ ] Deploy KIND testing infrastructure for validation

## 🔄 In Progress

### AI & Automation
- [ ] Implement AI-assisted debugging - **Foundation complete, needs LangChain integration**

### Platform & Infrastructure
- [ ] Optimize Kubernetes resource allocation - **KIND config ready, needs deployment testing**
- [ ] Implement auto-scaling for workspaces - **Resource management system ready**

## 📅 Up Next (Post Current Priorities)

### Missing AI Libraries Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] **LangChain Integration** - Multi-agent workflows for complex development tasks
- [ ] **Pinecone Migration** - Enterprise vector database for better scale  
- [ ] **Local Inference Deployment** - Ollama production setup for privacy & cost savings
- [ ] **MLflow Integration** - AI experiment tracking and model versioning

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Add unit tests for services modules - chat-mongodb (needs UUID mock fixes), collaboration (0% coverage)
- [ ] Fix existing failing tests - vector-db-adapter, ai-project-generator
- [ ] Add E2E tests for critical user journeys - workspace management, AI features, monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints - auth, AI chat, file operations, vector search

### Implementation Fixes
- [ ] Fix vector database implementation issues - PostgreSQL adapter needs DATABASE_URL/connectionString, SQL Server/Cosmos DB/Redis adapters not implemented, sharding-manager needs proper mocking
- [ ] Fix collaboration implementation issues - WorkspaceCollaboration needs Redis setup, collaboration-server missing dependencies (y-leveldb, y-websocket/bin/utils), Yjs CRDT needs proper persistence

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies for vector operations
- [ ] Add predictive scaling based on usage patterns
- [ ] Optimize database queries for large-scale operations

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add interactive code examples and tutorials
- [ ] Implement developer onboarding automation

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] Complete security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Implement advanced threat detection
- [ ] Add compliance reporting features
