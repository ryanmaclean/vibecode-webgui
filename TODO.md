# Staff Engineer Digest: VibeCode TODO.md

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-20

## High-Level Project Synthesis & Priorities

### 1. Key Issues & Resolutions

- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - Ingress Instability & Connection Resets:** The NGINX ingress controller was intermittently closing connections. This was fixed by reducing the `proxy-read-timeout` and `proxy-send-timeout` values to `90s`, preventing network devices from dropping idle WebSocket connections.

- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - Environment Consistency:** Environment variables were clarified, and `.env.local` was updated to prevent misconfiguration. The CI pipeline now has stable access to the necessary secrets.

- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - Test Suite Instability:** The CI pipeline now successfully runs the full test suite (`npm test`), including health checks, indicating that major instability and endpoint mismatches have been resolved.

- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED - CI Docker Builds:** The CI pipeline has been hardened to build Docker images for all critical services, ensuring container builds are verified on every commit.

nvironment, begin performance testing to identify bottlenecks.
    -   Use Datadog to monitor application performance under load and define SLOs.

- üü° **Pre-commit Hook Enforcement:**
    -   Address any remaining linting or syntax issues flagged by pre-commit hooks to improve code quality and developer velocity.
