# Staff Engineer Digest: VibeCode TODO.md

## High-Level Project Synthesis & Priorities

### 1. Immediate Blockers & Risks
- **Authentication/Authorization Failures:** Numerous `401/403` errors indicate systemic issues with session handling, environment variables, or API permissions. This is a critical path blocker for user access and feature validation.
- **Test Suite Instability:** Persistent Jest syntax errors (missing semicolons, parsing failures) and health check endpoint mismatches undermine CI reliability and mask regressions.
- **Environment Consistency:** Environment variables for OAuth, Datadog, and dev login are split across multiple secrets. Any misalignment or missing value breaks both local and cluster deployments.

### 2. Production Readiness
- **Kubernetes/Infra:** KIND cluster is robust, with Datadog, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Vector operational. Health checks and monitoring are in place, but probe/test endpoint mismatches remain.
- **Security:** Secrets are well-managed, but the presence of dev credentials and `--auth none` in demo deployments is a risk if not tightly scoped to non-prod.
- **Observability:** Datadog RUM/logs initialize, but repeated 401/403s may mean incomplete telemetry or noisy monitoring.

### 3. Testing & Automation
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** These are catching syntax issues, but errors are not being resolved promptly. This creates tech debt and slows developer velocity.
- **Test Coverage:** There‚Äôs a strong focus on unit, integration, and e2e tests, but test failures need to be actionable and prioritized.

### 4. Developer Experience
- **Quick Commands & Documentation:** The file provides excellent quick-start and troubleshooting commands, which is a best practice for onboarding and incident response.

---

## Top Priorities & Recommendations

### üî¥ Critical Path
1. **Resolve Authentication Issues:**
   - Systematically check all env vars for OAuth, Datadog, and session handling in both local and k8s contexts.
   - Use the dev credentials to verify the login flow; if successful, trace what changes post-authentication (cookies, tokens, API responses).
   - Instrument backend logs to correlate frontend 401/403s with backend errors.
2. **Fix Test Suite Failures:**
   - Batch-fix all missing semicolons and syntax errors in test files.
   - Align health check endpoints between deployment probes and test expectations.
3. **Consolidate and Document Environment Configuration:**
   - Create a single source of truth for all required environment variables (matrix for local, dev, prod).
   - Automate validation of env var presence at app startup.

### üü° Short-Term
- **Reduce Console Noise:** Silence expected 401/403s during unauthenticated states to avoid alert fatigue.
- **Review Security Posture:** Ensure dev credentials and open demo workspaces are not accessible in production or exposed clusters.

### üü¢ Medium/Long-Term
- **Automate Lint/Test Enforcement:** Block merges on unresolved pre-commit/test failures.
- **Enhance Observability:** Ensure Datadog RUM/logs are not just initializing, but also successfully reporting data (no silent failures).
- **Continuous Documentation:** Keep quick commands and troubleshooting sections updated as the stack evolves.

# VibeCode WebGUI - TODO List

## üöÄ PRODUCTION STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL (July 16, 2025)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Errors & Warnings (Pre-commit/Test)

- **Jest Syntax Errors (Missing Semicolons):**
  - `tests/unit/file-operations.test.ts: Missing semicolon. (22:13)`
  - `tests/unit/feature-flags.test.ts: Missing semicolon. (24:12)`
  - `tests/unit/collaboration.test.ts: Missing semicolon. (148:15)`
  - `tests/unit/ai-chat-interface.test.tsx: Missing semicolon. (12:24)`
- **Jest Unexpected Token/Parsing Errors:**
  - `tests/unit/claude-cli-integration.test.ts: Unexpected token, expected "," (43:0)`
- **Jest Test Suite Failures:**
  - Jest failed to parse files due to non-standard JavaScript/TypeScript syntax. See:
    - https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration
    - https://jestjs.io/docs/code-transformation
- **Production Readiness Test Failure:**
  - Health check endpoint test expects `/api/health`, but deployment uses `/`. Update probes or test expectations for alignment.
- **General Recommendations:**
  - Ensure Babel/Jest config supports TypeScript and any custom syntax used.
  - Review and fix all syntax errors and missing semicolons in test files.
  - Align health check endpoints with production readiness test expectations.
  - Review Jest transform and `transformIgnorePatterns` if using ES modules or advanced TypeScript features.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Console Errors: 401/403 (Unauthorized/Forbidden)

- **Observed in browser console:**
  - Repeated `403 (Forbidden)` and some `401 (Unauthorized)` errors when accessing resources.
  - Example log lines:
    - `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ()`
    - `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)`

### Possible Causes
- Frontend is trying to access protected API endpoints before authentication.
- Missing or invalid API keys/tokens (Datadog, OAuth, etc).
- Misconfigured access policies, CORS, or cookie/session issues.
- Datadog RUM/Logs scripts attempting to send data to endpoints requiring credentials.

### Troubleshooting/Action Items
- [ ] **Check Network Tab:** Identify which endpoints are returning 401/403 and why.
- [ ] **Verify Environment Variables:** Ensure all OAuth, Datadog, and auth env vars are present and correct in Kubernetes secrets and local `.env`.
- [ ] **Session/Cookie Issues:** Confirm cookies are being set and sent with requests; check for CORS or domain issues if using multiple localhost ports.
- [ ] **Datadog Config:** Verify RUM/Logs client tokens are valid and have correct permissions.
- [ ] **Test Dev Credentials:** Log in with `admin@vibecode.dev` / `admin123` and see if errors persist after authentication.
- [ ] **Backend Logs:** Review backend/Next.js API logs for details on denied requests.
- [ ] **If errors persist after login:** Identify failing endpoints, capture request URLs and response bodies, and analyze further.
