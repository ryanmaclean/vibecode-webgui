# Testing Strategy for VibeCode CLI

This document outlines the testing strategy for the `vibecode-cli` tool, with a focus on ensuring reliability across multiple deployment environments, including local development, Docker, KIND, Kubernetes, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Core Principles

1.  **Unit Testing for Logic**: The primary focus is on unit tests for the core logic of the CLI commands. We use `Jest` as the test runner and `ts-jest` for TypeScript support.
2.  **Component Testing for UI**: For testing the Ink-based UI components, we use the `ink-testing-library`. This allows us to render components to a string and assert that the output is correct without needing an interactive terminal.
3.  **Mocking External Services**: To ensure that our tests are fast, reliable, and can run in any environment (including CI/CD pipelines), we will **mock all external services and environment-specific APIs**. This is the key to testing across different deployment targets without needing a live connection.

## Environment-Specific Testing Strategy

Instead of running tests *in* each environment, we will simulate the behavior of each environment using mocks.

-   **Local Configuration**: Tests will mock file system interactions (e.g., reading a `fly.toml` file) to simulate different local configurations.
-   **Docker & Docker Compose**: When testing commands that interact with Docker, we will mock the Docker Engine API. This allows us to simulate responses for commands like `docker ps` or `docker-compose up` without needing a running Docker daemon.
-   **KIND, Kubernetes, & AKS**: For commands that interact with Kubernetes, we will mock the Kubernetes API client. This will allow us to test how our CLI handles different API responses (e.g., listing pods, checking service status) without needing a live connection to a Kubernetes cluster.

By using this mocking strategy, we can create a comprehensive test suite that validates the CLI's behavior in response to a wide range of simulated environmental conditions, ensuring that the tool is robust and reliable across all of your target platforms.
