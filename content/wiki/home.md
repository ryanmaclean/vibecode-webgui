# Welcome to the VibeCode Wiki

This is the home page for your project's wiki. You can use standard Markdown to create and edit pages.

Here are some ideas for what to include:

*   **Onboarding:** A guide for new contributors.
*   **Architecture:** An overview of the project's technical design.
*   **Deployment:** Instructions for deploying the application.

Try creating a new page by navigating to a non-existent route, for example: `[New Page](/wiki/my-new-page)`.
