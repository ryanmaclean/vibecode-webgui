# VibeCode Platform Overview

VibeCode is a cloud-native development platform designed to streamline the entire software development lifecycle. It provides developers with powerful, pre-configured, and secure development environments based on a Kubernetes-native architecture.

## Core Features

- **Kubernetes-Native Architecture:** VibeCode uses KIND (Kubernetes in Docker) to orchestrate development environments, eliminating 60-80% of custom development work.
- **AI-Powered Development:** The platform integrates AI at its core, featuring an AI Project Generator that turns natural language prompts into complete project structures. It also supports AI-assisted coding through VS Code extensions.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security:** VibeCode comes with fully configured Authelia 2FA/SSO authentication, protecting all ingress resources with hardware keys, TOTP, and Duo push notifications. It also integrates Datadog SAST/SCA for automated security scanning.
- **Comprehensive Observability:** It features a hybrid monitoring stack with Datadog and Prometheus, providing deep insights into application performance, database monitoring, and LLM operations.
- **GenAI Template Library:** VibeCode offers a curated library of MIT-licensed GenAI templates, including basic chat apps, semantic search, and RAG, to accelerate AI application development.
