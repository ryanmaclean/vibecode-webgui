# Azure PyTorch DSVM Starter

This template provides a ready-to-code environment for PyTorch development, inspired by the Azure Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM). It comes pre-configured with the essential tools and libraries for building, training, and optimizing deep learning models.

## What's Included

- **Python 3.10+**
- **PyTorch:** The core deep learning framework.
- **TorchVision:** Datasets, models, and image transformations for computer vision.
- **Jupyter:** For interactive notebook-based development and experimentation.
- **ONNX Runtime:** High-performance inference engine for running optimized models.
- **DeepSpeed:** A deep learning optimization library for training large models.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** State-of-the-art machine learning for JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow.

## Getting Started

1.  **Activate the Environment:** Your VibeCode workspace is already configured with all the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2.  **Run the Verification Script:** Execute the `main.py` script to verify the PyTorch installation and check for GPU availability:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3.  **Start Coding:** Begin building your model in `main.py` or create a new Jupyter Notebook to start experimenting.
