## Key Features

- **Infrastructure-First**: KIND (Kubernetes in Docker) orchestration eliminates 60-80% custom development
- **Multi-AI Provider Support**: Avoid vendor lock-in with intelligent routing across 6+ AI models
- **Production-Ready**: NGINX Ingress, cert-manager, Helm charts, persistent storage
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with comprehensive testing
- **Open Source**: MIT license with permissive dependencies (Apache 2.0, BSD, MPL-2.0)

## Architecture Overview

VibeCode leverages a **hybrid observability stack** that provides both enterprise features and vendor independence:

### Primary (Default): Datadog + Prometheus + Vector Hybrid
- **Datadog Agent + Cluster Agent**: Full-featured SaaS platform (commercial license)
- **Prometheus**: Open source metrics collection (Apache 2.0 license)  
- **Vector**: High-performance log/metrics router (MPL-2.0 license, by Datadog)
- **Combined Benefits**: Enterprise features + vendor independence + high-performance data pipeline

### Alternative Options (Permissive Licenses)
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Vendor-neutral telemetry (Apache 2.0 license)
- **Grafana**: Visualization layer (AGPL v3 license)
- **Full Open Source Stack**: Prometheus + OpenTelemetry + Vector + Grafana

### Security Analysis
- **Kubehound**: Kubernetes attack path analysis (by Datadog, open source)
